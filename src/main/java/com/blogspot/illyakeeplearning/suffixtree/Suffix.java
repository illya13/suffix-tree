/**
 * Defines suffix.
 * <p/>
 * When a new tree is added to the table, we step through all the currently defined suffixes
 * from the active point to the end point.  This structure defines a <b>Suffix</b> by its final character.
 * In the canonical representation, we define that last character by starting at a node in the tree,
 * and following a string of characters, represented by <b>first_char_index</b> and <b>last_char_index</b>.
 * The two indices point into the input string.  Note that if a suffix ends at a node,
 * there are no additional characters needed to characterize its last character position.
 * When this is the case, we say the node is <b>explicit</b>,
 * and set <b>first_char_index > last_char_index<b> to flag that.
